          <li>This week, I was mainly focused on nailing the concept for our game. In our team meetings, we decided to have our example game be <strong>Neon White</strong>.</li>
          <li>I spent a few hours playing Neon White in the last few weeks and noted different obstacles, abilities, and level design themes.</li>
          <li>It was important to nail down an inspiration game, as it felt at times that we were lacking direction.</li>
          <li>I implemented some core abilities this week, including:
            <ul>
              <li>A <strong>dash</strong> that launches the player in their desired direction.</li>
              <li>A barebones <strong>"teleport blade"</strong> that teleports players to a given surface if in range. More work is needed, but itâ€™s a good prototype.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>I also implemented art assets into the game, which was critical since the game looked very barebones at the time.</li>
          <li>In terms of obstacles, I added:
            <ul>
              <li>A <strong>"balloon"</strong> that serves as an extra jump for the player, allowing us to build unique level challenges.</li>
              <li>A <strong>boost panel</strong> that dramatically increases the player's speed, creating unique challenges.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          </li> I ran into a few challenges this mdp cycle. The main one was that my teammates were very busy, so I took on some extra work. Additionally, art assests were lagging behind, so there was some stress there. To overcome this challanges, I decided to do unplanned things like the baloon and boost panels to stay on track.</li>
          <li>This was a productive two weeks, but more work needs to be done!</li>

          <li>This week, I was mainly focused on nailing the frameworks for our game. In our team meetings.</li>
          <li>I spent a few hours playing Neon White in the last few weeks and noted different obstacles, abilities, and level design themes. I took inspiration from the book of life in the game.</li>
          <li>I implemented some core features this week, including:
            <ul>
              <li>A fully functioning <strong>"teleport blade"</strong> that throws a blade. The blade will either stick to a surface or stop moving after a given time. The player clicks again to teleport to the spot</li>
              <li>An <strong>"ability manager"</strong>. This system lets player hold up to two ability cards and use them accordingly with left and right click. Heavy inspiration taken from Neon White's card system. The goal for the visuals are akin to postvoid's hands</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>I also implemented a level based around the grapple hook. It is very fun and showcases a sense of speed for the player</li>
          </li> I ran into a few challenges this mdp cycle. The main one was that I was extremly busy with other classes and work for other student organizations. There wasn't a way to fix this besides working hard and trying to make time for WSoft!</li>
          <li>This was a productive two weeks, but more work needs to be done!</li>
