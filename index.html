          <li>This week, I was mainly focused on nailing the concept for our game. In our team meetings, we decided to have our example game be <strong>Neon White</strong>.</li>
          <li>I spent a few hours playing Neon White in the last few weeks and noted different obstacles, abilities, and level design themes.</li>
          <li>It was important to nail down an inspiration game, as it felt at times that we were lacking direction.</li>
          <li>I implemented some core abilities this week, including:
            <ul>
              <li>A <strong>dash</strong> that launches the player in their desired direction.</li>
              <li>A barebones <strong>"teleport blade"</strong> that teleports players to a given surface if in range. More work is needed, but itâ€™s a good prototype.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>I also implemented art assets into the game, which was critical since the game looked very barebones at the time.</li>
          <li>In terms of obstacles, I added:
            <ul>
              <li>A <strong>"balloon"</strong> that serves as an extra jump for the player, allowing us to build unique level challenges.</li>
              <li>A <strong>boost panel</strong> that dramatically increases the player's speed, creating unique challenges.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>This was a productive two weeks, but more work needs to be done!</li>
