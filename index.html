          This week, I was mainly focused on nailing the concept for our game. In our team meetings, we decided to have our example game be Neon White. I spent a few hours playing Neon white in the last few weeks. I noted different obsicles, abilities, level design themes. It was important to nail down an inspiration game as it felt at times that we were lacking direction. Additionally, I implemented some core abilities this week. I added a dash, which launches the player in their desired direction. I implemented a barebons "teleport blade", which teleports players to a given surface if in range. More needs to be added to the teleport blade, but it is a good prototype.
